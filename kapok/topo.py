    """Solve for the ground coherence using a line fit of the observed
        coherences.
    
        Arguments:
            gamma (array): Array containing the complex coherences to line
                fit.  Should have dimensions (2, azimuth, range).
                gamma[0,:,:] should contain one of the coherences to line fit,
                and gamma[1,:,:] should contain the other (e.g., from phase
                diversity coherence optimization).
            kz: The kz values.  If specified, the algorithm will choose
                between the two ground coherence solutions by assuming that
                the phase difference between the high coherence and the
                ground is less than pi.  If this behaviour is not
                desired, see the gammavol argument for another method for
                choosing between the ground coherences.  Note that only the
                sign of kz, not the magnitude, matters here.  The input can
                therefore either be the 2D array of kz values, or simply a
                scalar with the same sign as the actual kz.
            groundmag (array): Magnitude of the ground coherence.
            gammavol (array): Array containing coherences that are assumed
                to be closer to the volume-dominated coherence than the
                ground-dominated coherence.  If specified, the ground
                solver will always choose the ground solution that is
                farther (on the complex plane) from gammavol.  Note:
                Selection of the ground solution through the kz is
                recommended (see above), as it is generally more
                robust.
            returnall (bool): If set to True, function will return the
                ground solutions, as well as the other ground solution
                not chosen, and an array identifying which of the two
                input coherences in gamma are the volume-dominated
                coherence.  If False, only the chosen ground solution
                will be returned.
            silent (bool): If set to True, no output status will be
                printed.
            
        Returns:
            ground (array): Array of complex-valued ground coherences.
            groundalt (array): The other ground solutions which were not
                chosen.  Only returned if returnall == True.
            volindex (array): 2D array containing the index of the high/volume
                (smallest ground contribution) coherence for each pixel.
                If gamma[0,azimuth,range] is closer to the vol coherence
                than gamma[1,azimuth,range], volindex[azimuth,range] will
                equal 0.  Only returned if returnall == True.

                coherence magnitude is equal to one.  If specified,
                this function will find the intersections between
                the fitted line and a circle with radius equal to
                gammag.  If these intersections are within the
                observed coherences, the solutions will be moved
                along the line until they are on top of the closest
                observed coherence.  There will always be one

                coherence farthest from the first ground solution.
                In general, this should be a rare situation to
